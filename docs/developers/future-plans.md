# 🚀 Future Roadmap & Plans

This document outlines the vision for **TaxBrokerReport** and the features we hope to implement in the coming seasons.

## 📅 Upcoming Goals

### 1. Robustness & Maintenance

Our primary concern is ensuring that Trade Republic's official 2025 reports (released in 2026) remain compatible.

* **PDF Stability**: We hope that the PDF structure won't be significantly altered in a way that makes it unparsable by our current logic.
* **Rapid Updates**: If changes do occur, our priority is to update the parsing logic as quickly as possible before the filing deadline.

### 2. Python Library Expansion

To make the core logic more accessible to the developer community:

* **PDF-to-Data Library**: We plan to decouple the parsing engine into a standalone **Python library**.
* **Integrations**: This will allow other developers to build their own tools or scripts on top of our proven Trade Republic parsing logic without needing the full C++/Qt environment.

### 3. Support for Additional Brokers

While currently focused on Trade Republic, we are looking into supporting other popular brokers among Slovenian investors (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Revolut). Please note that this is a **stretch goal planned for several years down the line**, as our main focus remains on maintaining support for Trade Republic.
