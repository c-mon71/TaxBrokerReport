* **Download:** `TaxBrokerReport-Win64.zip`

### ⚠️ Important: Bypassing Apple Gatekeeper

Because this is an independent open-source project and does not have a $100/year Apple developer license for official code signing, macOS will initially block it.

**How to allow it (Required only once):**

* Try to open the app. You will see a warning: *"TaxBrokerReport cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."*
* Click **Cancel**.
* Go to **System Settings** -> **Privacy & Security**.
* Scroll down to the **Security** section.
* You will see: *"TaxBrokerReport was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer."*
* Click **"Open Anyway"** and enter your administrator password.
* On the final popup, click **Open**.
