Explanatory Notes

1.   Introduction
     1.1. The Income, Gains and Losses Report (the ''Report'') is intended to be read together with the legal information and disclaimer document ("Legal Information") and these explanatory
           notes. Together they have been prepared for your convenience and we believe these will be helpful in completing your income tax return. The Report is provided for information purposes
           only and in no circumstances should this Report and the data contained in it be used without further verification and clarification for completing your tax return. This Report is not
           intended, and should not be sent to the tax authorities, to fulfil your individual tax return obligations. This Report has been prepared on a best efforts basis and given the complexity
           matter you or your tax advisor should verify all information contained in this Report with reference to contract, advice and transaction notes and statements and any other available
           information. If in doubt, you should seek tax advice.

2.   General reporting assumptions
     2.1. Currency – Generally, conversions from the transaction currency of the investment to the Reporting Currency have been converted at the ECB and/or OANDA. This may differ from other
          conversions to Reporting Currency shown on other documents of the Bank including but not limited to your contract and advice notes.
     2.2. Data – This Report is based on information processed in our systems as at January following the fiscal year in scope and may not reflect subsequent bookings which impact transactions
          that took place during the period indicated in the header.
     2.3. Fees and Expenses – Whilst best efforts have been made to record accurately all expenses and fees relating to the transactions, the Bank accepts no liability for any errors or omissions
          or for any consequential loss arising.
     2.4. Layout – Securities are shown divided in Country and ISIN.

3.   Income Section
     3.1. Dividends and interest – Dividends and interest payments have been disclosed in this Report based on the Transaction Date. It may be that such treatment does not match the Country
          of Residence tax rules for the categorization and recognition of this income. Therefore you, or your tax advisor, are strongly advised to check that the dividends have been correctly
          categorized and recorded in the correct tax year.
     3.2. Reinvestments and stock dividends – The amount of the dividend and the cash foregone have been included in the income section.
     3.3. Income payment/alternatives to cash dividends – Due to the variety of alternative dividend possibilities that are now offered by overseas companies, we strongly recommend that each
          event should be investigated as we cannot guarantee that it has been correctly recorded in this Report.
     3.4. Foreign income – It should be noted that foreign income is shown where possible with the tax withheld at source and if in doubt you should check your advice statements. The double
          tax relief that you may be able to claim on your tax return may be restricted under the relevant double taxation agreement with the Country of Residence.
     3.5. Withholding tax rates – Withholding tax rates have been rounded to two decimal places.
     3.6. Accrued income – If you have purchased or sold accrued income securities, a charge or relief may arise and this charge/relief is taken into account on the next interest payment date of
          the same security. This report records accrued income at the date of purchase or sale in the tax year, but provides details of the next interest payment date. Only accrued interest that is
          relevant for this tax year is included. As a result, it may be possible that accrued interest on purchases or sale in the prior tax year that are relevant for this tax year are not shown in this
          Report.
     3.7. Referral Bonus and Stock Perk – Please note, that if you have received a referral bonus or stock perk it has been considered in the report as income in the income section. This is a general
          approach. In case of any doubts about this approach, please consult with your tax advisor.

4.   Capital and Income gain and loss sections
     4.1. Calculations – The Bank is not in a position to provide tax advice so all calculations (including part disposals) contained in this Report need to be verified. In order for you to be able to do
           so, we have provided in the transaction history section the calculation history that is available in our banking system, including purchases, disposals and corporate actions relevant for
           each disposal event.

     4.2.   Historical data – is provided on a best efforts basis and is for information purposes only and the completeness and accuracy should be independently verified. Furthermore, neither it may
            not be a full and complete list of all corresponding historical information nor it might be in line with the relevant tax law in the country of residency.



5.   Capital gain and loss summary (‘’summary section’’)
     5.1. The summary section provides an overview of all chargeable capital gains and allowable capital losses for the relevant tax year in a layout that follows:
          5.1.1. Total Amount of Disposals – all the disposal occurred in the tax period are sum, divided by the asset category.
          5.1.2. Total Amount of Purchases – all the relevant cost of purchases are sum in accordance with the asset category.
          5.1.3. Total Amount of Expenses – all the relevant fees, always in accordance with the asset category, are display in the relevant column.

6.   Capital Gains and Losses section (‘’report sections’’)
     6.1. Conversion to Reporting Currency – Each disposal event during the tax year is shown in Reporting Currency in one of these sections depending on the asset classification.
     6.2. Verification of all calculations - All gain and loss calculations should be verified individually. It should be noted that whilst every endeavour has been made to ensure that the calculation
           methodology applied to each instrument is in line with the tax rules applicable in the Residence Country, there may be discrepancies. Certain adjustments may therefore be necessary
           for tax purposes and it is recommended that you seek independent tax advice on this.
     6.3. Calculation method – The order of matching applied within the Report follows the order of the Client.
     6.4. Rounding issues – The transaction data applied for the purposes of these calculations includes two decimal places in relation to the nominal holding of assets. Accordingly, the calculation
           engine may result in some rounding differences in comparison to transaction data on advice notes and statements.
     6.5. Cryptocurrencies – In the case of cryptocurrency disposals, a gain/loss calculation has been made and displayed in the Capital Gains and Losses section. In case of any doubts about this
           approach, please consult with your tax advisor.

7.   Withholding Tax section
     7.1. All withholding tax that are present in the income section are display in this section. Please check if you can ask for a Withholding tax refund. Please be aware to apply for a Withholding
          tax refund, you have to consider the different forms and applications deadlines depending on each country jurisdiction within the (limited) application time.

8.   Transfer In and Out section
     8.1. Transfer In and Transfer Out are reported in these sections as follows:
          8.1.1. All relevant transfer in are reported in this section. Only the asset affected with a sale in the tax period are listed.
          8.1.2. All the Transfer Out occurred in the tax period are listed.

9.   Transaction History and Corporate Actions section
     9.1. Ordering – The transaction history is in ISIN order.
     9.2. Older historical information – Only the relative information for the sale are listed in the transaction history, it means that historical information of a security which has previously been
          fully disposed of for tax purposes prior to a new acquisition are not shown.
     9.3. As no country-specific laws are applied in the Generic Report, corporate actions etc. will be classified in this report using standard methods without them being enriched by further
          external data (e.g. for fund performance data). Transaction naming and calculations may not be in accordance with the Residence Country tax treatment. Tax rules are complex and the
          tax consequences of corporate actions can vary depending on the precise circumstances. The Bank cannot accept any liability for any errors or omissions arising from the consequences
          of corporate actions, and you should verify the income, gain and loss calculations of each corporate action accordingly. If in doubt, please contact your tax advisor.
     9.4. In case of Corporate Action there are the information of the previous asset or the other way around of the following asset.
     9.5. Market Value – The market value used for cost apportionments and calculations is the end of day price of the asset.
     9.6. Relevant/effective date – the date use in the transaction history section is the taxable date. It is the same date used to make the calculations of the capital gain.
